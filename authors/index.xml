      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a Ph.D. Computer Science student in the Principles of Expressive Machines (POEM) Lab under the advisement of Dr. Chris Martens, at North Carolina State University. My general research interests are in the field of narrative and game artificial intelligence. I model and study large populations of humans by simulating small-scale social interactions that take into account real-world geographic constraints, logistics, lifestyles, and social influence dynamics. With my research I aim to support a variety of applications, such as examining the implications of social science theories and developing playable, explorable story worlds. I believe my research would afford increased entertainment, immersion and replayability for users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to NC State, I was a Research Lab Associate Intern, Disney Research Pittsburgh under the advisement of Dr. Boyang Li in the Narrative Intelligence Lab. Before that I completed my M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology under the advisement of Dr. Mark Riedl in the Entertainment Intelligence Lab.&lt;/p&gt;
