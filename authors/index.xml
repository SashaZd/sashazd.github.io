      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a Ph.D. Computer Science student in the Principles of Expressive Machines (POEM) Lab under the advisement of Dr. Chris Martens, at North Carolina State University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My general research interests are in the field of narrative and game artificial intelligence. I model and study large populations of humans by simulating small-scale social interactions that take into account real-world geographic constraints, logistics, lifestyles, and social influence dynamics. With my research I aim to support a variety of applications, such as examining the implications of social science theories and developing playable, explorable story worlds. I believe my research could have wide applications to generate narratives, or model, simulate and analyze phenomena of interest. Additionally, such a simulation would afford increased entertainment, immersion and replayability for users.&lt;/p&gt;
