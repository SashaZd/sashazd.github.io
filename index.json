In this paper, we introduce a Spectrum of Audience Interactivity that establishes a common vocabulary for the design space across entertainment domains. Our spectrum expands on an early vocabulary conceptualized through co-design sessions for interactive musical performances. We conduct a cross-disciplinary literature review to evaluate and iterate upon this vocabulary, using our findings to develop our validated spectrum.","tags":["audience interaction","entertainment","agency","immersion"],"title":"A Spectrum of Audience Interactivity for Entertainment Domains (Nominated for best paper)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Spencer Rugaber","Shruti Bhati","Vedanuj Goswami","Evangelia Spiliopoulou","Sasha Azad","Sridevi Koushik","Rishikesh Kulkarni","Mithun Kumble","Sriya Sarathy","Ashok Goel"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1572913173,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572913173,"objectID":"a4e00bbacdd7ecbc91fd5bdd82e8a982","permalink":"https://sashazd.github.io/publication/icbr-cognopsi/","publishdate":"2016-10-31T19:19:33-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/icbr-cognopsi/","section":"publication","summary":"Biologically inspired design (BID) is a methodology for designing technological systems by analogy to designs of biological systems. Given that knowledge of many biological systems is available mostly in the form of textual documents, the question becomes how can we extract design knowledge about biological systems from textual documents for potential use in designing engineering systems? In earlier work, we described how annotating biology articles with partial Structure-Behavior-Function models helps users access documents relevant to a given design problem and understand the biological systems for potential transfer of their causal mechanisms to engineering problems. In this paper, we present an automated technique instantiated in the IBID system for extracting partial SBF models of biological systems from their natural language documents for potential use in biologically inspired design.","tags":[],"title":"Knowledge extraction and annotation for cross-domain textual case-based reasoning in biologically inspired design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sasha Azad"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1572639745,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572639745,"objectID":"7e41b0824701f859d952cb1843401d80","permalink":"https://sashazd.github.io/publication/phd-quals/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T16:22:25-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/phd-quals/","section":"publication","summary":"We conducted a human-subjects study of Lyra to evaluate the generated conversations and affinity groups for their believability and to inform future iterations of the simulation.
