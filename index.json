I model and study large populations of humans by simulating small-scale social interactions that take into account real-world geographic constraints, logistics, lifestyles, and social influence dynamics. With my research I aim to support a variety of applications, such as examining the implications of social science theories and developing playable, explorable story worlds. I believe my research could have wide applications to generate narratives, or model, simulate and analyze phenomena of interest. Additionally, such a simulation would afford increased entertainment, immersion and replayability for users.\nIn the Past Research Lab Associate Intern, Disney Research Pittsburgh (Aug \u0026lsquo;16 - Jun \u0026lsquo;17\u0026rsquo;) | Advisor: Dr. Boyang Li | Lab: Narrative Intelligence Lab M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology (May 2016) | Advisor: Dr. Mark Riedl | Lab: Entertainment Intelligence Lab.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Ph.D. Computer Science student in the Principles of Expressive Machines (POEM) Lab under the advisement of Dr. Chris Martens, at North Carolina State University.\nMy general research interests are in the field of narrative and game artificial intelligence.
