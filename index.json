We present Anthology, an extensible software framework for modeling human social systems, within the context of an ongoing research agenda to integrate AI techniques from social simulation games and computational social science to enable researchers to model and reason about the complex dynamics of human social behavior. Anthology comprises a motive-based agent decision making algorithm; a knowledge representation system for relationships; a flexible specification language for precondition-effect-style actions; a user interface to inspect and interact with the simulation as it runs in real-time; and an extensive user documentation and reference manual.

However, research groups work in isolation, designing and discussing their character models with disparate approaches, often using project-specific terminology. This makes it challenging to identify, classify, and accumulate existing knowledge. It is our position that since modelling of virtual characters has become an integral part of the scientific practice in our field, we must develop a common taxonomy to discuss these models. With this goal in mind, we conduct an in-depth analysis of a selection of projects, categorizing existing agent social interactions, and comparing results from research-based and commercial social simulation works in the entertainment domain. We conceptualize a taxonomy that classifies agent interactions by their social behaviours, inter-agent communication, knowledge flow, and the change in their relationships. We posit such a taxonomy would allow scientists to reproduce and evaluate existing models, collaborate on standards, share advances with other researchers and practitioners, allow for better communication and methodologies developed for new techniques, and allow for a more rigorous model-to-model analysis.","tags":["social simulation","non-player characters","game design","taxonomy","vocabulary","conceptual tools","social behaviours","social relationships","emotions","virtual characters","artificial life","artifial societies","knowledge model"],"title":"Little Computer People: A Survey and Taxonomy of Simulated Models of Social Interaction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brenden Lech","Sasha Azad","Jennifer Welnitz","Joel Jonasson","Chris Martens"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1633983252,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633983252,"objectID":"bb843aebd228d78c86257ac998bc4c98","permalink":"https://sashazd.github.io/publication/lech-2021-designing/","publishdate":"2021-10-11T16:14:12-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/lech-2021-designing/","section":"publication","summary":"Procedural content generation (PCG) has seen relative widespread adoption in games and game development.

We discuss our choice of game artificial intelligence algorithms, decisions made in designing our system, and our progress and implementation under the constraints and requirements given to us.
