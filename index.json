In this paper, we introduce a Spectrum of Audience Interactivity that establishes a common vocabulary for the design space across entertainment domains. Our spectrum expands on an early vocabulary conceptualized through co-design sessions for interactive musical performances. We conduct a cross-disciplinary literature review to evaluate and iterate upon this vocabulary, using our findings to develop our validated spectrum.","tags":["audience interaction","entertainment","agency","immersion"],"title":"A Spectrum of Audience Interactivity for Entertainment Domains (Nominated for best paper)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sasha Azad"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1572639745,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572639745,"objectID":"7e41b0824701f859d952cb1843401d80","permalink":"https://sashazd.github.io/publication/phd-quals/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T16:22:25-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/phd-quals/","section":"publication","summary":"We conducted a human-subjects study of Lyra to evaluate the generated conversations and affinity groups for their believability and to inform future iterations of the simulation.
