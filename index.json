Modeling social agents is widely considered to be a long-term research goal in the fields of entertainment, ecology, and computational social science. Bolstered by this growing interest in simulating social agents, research on agent models has spanned topics such as planning, procedural storytelling, and decision-making. However, social simulation research groups work in isolation, designing and discussing their character models with disparate approaches, often using project-specific terminology. This disparity makes identifying, classifying, and accumulating existing knowledge in the domain challenging.\nI propose that since the modeling of agents has become an integral part of the scientific practice in our field, we must develop a common taxonomy and framework to discuss and simulate these agents. With this goal in mind, we conducted an in-depth analysis of a selection of projects, categorizing existing agent social interactions and comparing results from research-based and commercial social simulation works in the entertainment domain. We conceptualized a taxonomy that classifies agent interactions by their inter-agent behaviors, formalizes rules for the interaction space, and describes the effect of these behaviors on the social state of the agents. Further, I was able to combine methodologies from agent-based simulation systems and discrete event simulation to create a modular and flexible social physics engine. To our knowledge, this is the first time these methodologies have been integrated in this way.\nThis project describes our efforts to evaluate and operationalize a taxonomy and an accompanying framework or ``social physics engine’’. Our taxonomy and accompanying framework would allow scientists to reproduce and evaluate existing models, collaborate on standards, share advances with other researchers and practitioners, allow for better communication and methodologies developed for new techniques, and allow for a more rigorous model-to-model analysis.\n","date":1706731491,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1706731491,"objectID":"305133a6431af4af65078c35df0f6d08","permalink":"https://sashazd.github.io/project/little-computer-people/","publishdate":"2024-01-31T16:04:51-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/little-computer-people/","section":"project","summary":"The goal of this project is to model and study large populations of humans by simulating small-scale social interactions that take into account social influence dynamics, human behaviors, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and social science.

Given that knowledge of many biological systems is available mostly in the form of textual documents, the question becomes how can we extract design knowledge about biological systems from textual documents for potential use in designing engineering systems? In earlier work, we described how annotating biology articles with partial Structure-Behavior-Function models helps users access documents relevant to a given design problem and understand the biological systems for potential transfer of their causal mechanisms to engineering problems. In this paper, we present an automated technique instantiated in the IBID system for extracting partial SBF models of biological systems from their natural language documents for potential use in biologically inspired design.","tags":["Case Based Reasoning","Biologically Inspired Design","SBF Modelling","Semantic Annotation","Natural Language Processing"],"title":"Knowledge extraction and annotation for cross-domain textual case-based reasoning in biologically inspired design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sasha Azad"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1471305600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1471305600,"objectID":"9796ab292ac746e504043c933d591d30","permalink":"https://sashazd.github.io/talk/2015-ggdc-keynote/","publishdate":"2024-02-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2015-ggdc-keynote/","section":"talk","summary":"Join the GGDA and Microsoft at Georgia Tech for an overview of the Hololens, its capabilities and the opportunities it brings you.
