We posit that these algorithms can enhance the gameplay experience in mixed reality games. We present two prototype games that use procedural content generation to design levels that make use of the affordances in the playerâ€™s physical environment. The levels produced can be tailored to a user, customizing gameplay difficulty and affecting how the player moves around the real-world environment.},

  abstract = {Biologically inspired design (BID) is a methodology for designing technological systems by analogy to designs of biological systems. Given that knowledge of many biological systems is available mostly in the form of textual documents, the question becomes how can we extract design knowledge about biological systems from textual documents for potential use in designing engineering systems? In earlier work, we described how annotating biology articles with partial Structure-Behavior-Function models helps users access documents relevant to a given design problem and understand the biological systems for potential transfer of their causal mechanisms to engineering problems. In this paper, we present an automated technique instantiated in the IBID system for extracting partial SBF models of biological systems from their natural language documents for potential use in biologically inspired design.}

  abstract = {A live interactive narrative (LIN) is an experience where multiple players take on fictional roles and interact with real-world objects and actors to participate in a pre-authored narrative. Temporal properties of LINs are important to its viability and aesthetic quality and hence deserve special design consideration. In this paper, we tackle the largely overlooked problem of scheduling a multiplayer interactive narrative and propose the Live Interactive Narrative Scheduling Problem (LINSP), which handles reasoning under temporal uncertainty, resource scheduling, and non-linear plot choices. We present a mixed-integer linear programming formulation of the problem and empirically evaluates its scalability over large narrative instances.}

  title={Towards Generating Narratives for the Real World},

  booktitle={Fourteenth Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment Conference},
  year={2018},
  abstract = {An immersive, interactive environment and the non-player characters populating it often play a key role in interactive narrative experiences. We posit that if a procedurally generated narrative is better able to reflect real-world attributes of the player's surroundings, then the experience would be more transportive for the player. With this comes the problem of generating believable narratives and characters for an open, complex, real world. Simulating such a society within the constraints of the real environment, and allowing for virtual characters to more accurately mimic human behavior could increase the believability of the agents. The interactions amongst these agents sharing their cultural views, biases, and histories based on their real-world geolocation could inform the study of audience modeling and machine enculturation, allowing computers to learn or reason about social norms in regions. Finally, we posit this research would afford better applications in the field of entertainment or computational social science.}

  author={Striner, Alina and Azad, Sasha and Martens, Chris},
  booktitle={Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling (ICIDS)},
  year={2019},
  abstract = {The concept of audience interactivity has been rediscovered across many domains of storytelling and entertainment---e.g. digital games, in-person role-playing, film, theater performance, music, and theme parks---that enrich the form with new idioms, language, and practices. In this paper, we introduce a Spectrum of Audience Interactivity that establishes a common vocabulary for the design space across entertainment domains. Our spectrum expands on an early vocabulary conceptualised through co-design sessions for interactive musical performances. We conduct a cross-disciplinary literature review to evaluate and iterate upon this vocabulary, using our findings to develop our validated spectrum.}

  abstract = {Creating believable simulations of large populations of characters in virtual worlds represents a grand challenge for interactive artificial intelligence, requiring reasoning about social intelligence. In this paper, we focus on one aspect of this challenge: the dynamics of opinion change for virtual characters and its relationship with social affinity. We developed a simulated population of characters that debate politically-charged topics, called Lyra. Characters? knowledge, opinions, and biases spread through this society based on existing cognitive models and social science theories. Our simulation generates outlines of group conversations that portray the system?s evolution, and clusters characters into affinity groups based on the outcome of the debates. We conducted a human-subjects study to evaluate these generated conversations and affinity groups for their believability and to inform future iterations of the simulation. We believe successful simulation of opinion change in social dynamics provides a foundation for computational recognition, prediction, and interfacing with humans.}
