  abstract={Social simulation research seeks to understand the dynamics of complex human behavior by simulating populations of individual decision-makers as multi-agent systems. However, prior work in games and entertainment fail to account for interactions between social behavior, geography, and relationships in a manner that allows researchers to easily reuse their frameworks and model social characters. We present Anthology, an extensible software framework for modeling human social systems, within the context of an ongoing research agenda to integrate AI techniques from social simulation games and computational social science to enable researchers to model and reason about the complex dynamics of human social behavior. Anthology comprises a motive-based agent decision making algorithm; a knowledge representation system for relationships; a flexible specification language for precondition-effect-style actions; a user interface to inspect and interact with the simulation as it runs in real-time; and an extensive user documentation and reference manual. We describe our participatory research design process used for the developing Anthology, the state of the current system, it's limitations and our future development directions.},

  abstract={Bolstered by a growing interest in simulating believable non-player characters (NPCs), work on NPC models has spanned topics such as planning, procedural storytelling, decision-making, and social dynamics. However, research groups work in isolation, designing and discussing their character models with disparate approaches, often using project-specific terminology. This makes it challenging to identify, classify, and accumulate existing knowledge. It is our position that since modelling of virtual characters has become an integral part of the scientific practice in our field, we must develop a common taxonomy to discuss these models. With this goal in mind, we conduct an in-depth analysis of a selection of projects, categorizing existing agent social interactions, and comparing results from research-based and commercial social simulation works in the entertainment domain. We conceptualize a taxonomy that classifies agent interactions by their social behaviours, inter-agent communication, knowledge flow, and the change in their relationships. We posit such a taxonomy would allow scientists to reproduce and evaluate existing models, collaborate on standards, share advances with other researchers and practitioners, allow for better communication and methodologies developed for new techniques, and allow for a more rigorous model-to-model analysis.},

  abstract = {Procedural content generation (PCG) has seen relative widespread adoption in games and game development. While PCG methods are gaining traction in commercial games, there are comparatively fewer cases where PCG has been used to generate the game world, characters, and the narrative for a single game. We present our research, collaborating with a small independent game studio, on the design of a game engine designed to generate a world, characters, supporting quests and overarching narrative content for their upcoming game. We discuss our choice of game artificial intelligence algorithms, decisions made in designing our system, and our progress and implementation under the constraints and re- quirements given to us. We posit our system will generate a rich game world with an explainable world history for players to explore and quests to complete. We believe that our engine will meet their requirements increasing the replayability of the game, reducing the authorship burden, while providing the authors with significant control over quest and narrative structure.}

In this paper, we introduce a Spectrum of Audience Interactivity that establishes a common vocabulary for the design space across entertainment domains. Our spectrum expands on an early vocabulary conceptualised through co-design sessions for interactive musical performances. We conduct a cross-disciplinary literature review to evaluate and iterate upon this vocabulary, using our findings to develop our validated spectrum.}

We are a small studio in Sweden trying to develop such a game for the mobile market (working title “Lance a Lot”). Our game adopts role-playing game conventions, such as an explorable world map, non-player characters, and quests. It is our aim to develop as our” story engine” a system capable of procedurally generating quests and narratives to guide the gameplay experience. Such a system would encourage replayability and ensure players never run out of content to experience, while affording players more agency to shape the narrative and the world through their actions. Our approach to knitting together multiple kinds of procedural generation involves two types of generators: abstract and concrete.}

  abstract = {Creating believable simulations of large populations of characters in virtual worlds represents a grand challenge for interactive artificial intelligence, requiring reasoning about social intelligence. In this paper, we focus on one aspect of this challenge: the dynamics of opinion change for virtual characters and its relationship with social affinity. We developed a simulated population of characters that debate politically-charged topics, called Lyra. Characters? knowledge, opinions, and biases spread through this society based on existing cognitive models and social science theories. Our simulation generates outlines of group conversations that portray the system?s evolution, and clusters characters into affinity groups based on the outcome of the debates. We conducted a human-subjects study to evaluate these generated conversations and affinity groups for their believability and to inform future iterations of the simulation. We believe successful simulation of opinion change in social dynamics provides a foundation for computational recognition, prediction, and interfacing with humans.}

  abstract = {A number of recent models for empirically-grounded social simulation have emerged recently from games and interactive narrative research, generally exploring models of trust, emotion, and social graph changes that occur in the process of inter-character interactions. However, these models so far failed to provide realistic models of opinion change and predisposition to new knowledge. Equipped with such a notion, these emergent social simulations can express both real and fictionalized depictions of modern phenomena like adverse media influence, the spread of “fake news,” and the polarization of ideological sects. We present a preliminary computational investigation into modeling opinion change in virtual characters with this goal in mind.}

  abstract = {An immersive, interactive environment and the non-player characters populating it often play a key role in interactive narrative experiences. We posit that if a procedurally generated narrative is better able to reflect real-world attributes of the player's surroundings, then the experience would be more transportive for the player. With this comes the problem of generating believable narratives and characters for an open, complex, real world. Simulating such a society within the constraints of the real environment, and allowing for virtual characters to more accurately mimic human behavior could increase the believability of the agents. The interactions amongst these agents sharing their cultural views, biases, and histories based on their real-world geolocation could inform the study of audience modeling and machine enculturation, allowing computers to learn or reason about social norms in regions. Finally, we posit this research would afford better applications in the field of entertainment or computational social science.}

  abstract = {A live interactive narrative (LIN) is an experience where multiple players take on fictional roles and interact with real-world objects and actors to participate in a pre-authored narrative. Temporal properties of LINs are important to its viability and aesthetic quality and hence deserve special design consideration. In this paper, we tackle the largely overlooked problem of scheduling a multiplayer interactive narrative and propose the Live Interactive Narrative Scheduling Problem (LINSP), which handles reasoning under temporal uncertainty, resource scheduling, and non-linear plot choices. We present a mixed-integer linear programming formulation of the problem and empirically evaluates its scalability over large narrative instances.}

Given that knowledge of many biological systems is available mostly in the form of textual documents, the question becomes how can we extract design knowledge about biological systems from textual documents for potential use in designing engineering systems? In earlier work, we described how annotating biology articles with partial Structure-Behavior-Function models helps users access documents relevant to a given design problem and understand the biological systems for potential transfer of their causal mechanisms to engineering problems. In this paper, we present an automated technique instantiated in the IBID system for extracting partial SBF models of biological systems from their natural language documents for potential use in biologically inspired design.}
