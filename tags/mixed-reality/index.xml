      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the wide-scale availability of mobile devices, and more recently the adoption of augmented reality (AR) technologies, researchers have manually authored narratives to document cultural heritage and community-based narratives or goals as well as procedurally generated narratives for various geo-locations populated with NPCs. My research focuses on the affordances and constraints of real-world geographic constraints, logistics, lifestyles to generate interactive experiences for the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We argue that mixed reality games benefit from artificial intelligence beyond machine vision surface detection. In particular, we argue that a class of artificial intelligence algorithms called Procedural Content Generation (PCG) can automatically optimize players’ gameplay experience by accounting for the specific configuration of players’ unique physical environments. Procedural content generation is the use of algorithms to automate the production of various aspects of computer games, such as terrain, levels, missions, weapons, and monsters. Artificial intelligence approaches to PCG treat the creation of game content as an optimization problem —- the attempt to find a set of parameters for a specific type of content that maximizes an evaluation function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We introduce a mixed reality game, MR Lemmings, which uses PCG algorithms to place a set of virtual game assets that will affect the player’s interaction with the physical environment. The game was developed as a prototype for the exploration of the ways in which procedural content generation can reason about the affordances of physical environments in mixed reality games.&lt;/p&gt;
